      👋 Welcome to KIU LMS Notifier Bot!
      
      📋 Here's how to get started:
      
      1️⃣ Register your LMS token:

      • Follow the instructions to upload your token file
      
      2️⃣ Initialize your courses:

      • Get notifications about new posts and homework
      
      🕒 Automatic Scheduler:
      • The bot automatically checks your LMS 3 times a day — at 11:00, 16:00, and 20:00 (Tbilisi time)
      • You’ll receive updates even if you don’t run /check_news yourself
      • Sit back and let the bot keep you in the loop 📬
      
      💡 Tip: Use /commands to see all available commands.
      
      🚀 Let’s begin! Type "register token" to start registration.
